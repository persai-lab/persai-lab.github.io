In PersAI Lab, we research on human-centered data science, including recommender systems and personalized education problems. Specific themes of our research include:

- **Recommender Systems**
    - cross-domain recommender systems
    - multi-source and multi-objective recommender systems
    - community-based collaborative filtering
- **Learning analytics and educational Data Mining**
    - personalized student sequencing
    - student knowledge modeling
    - learning resource recommendations
    - learner behavior modeling and prediction
    - domain knowledge modeling in unstructured contexts
