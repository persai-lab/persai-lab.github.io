<p>In PersAI Lab, we research on human-centered data science, including recommender systems and personalized education problems. Specific themes of our research include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Recommender Systems</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>cross-domain recommender systems</li>
      <li>multi-source and multi-objective recommender systems</li>
      <li>community-based collaborative filtering</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Learning analytics and educational Data Mining</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>personalized student sequencing</li>
      <li>student knowledge modeling</li>
      <li>learning resource recommendations</li>
      <li>learner behavior modeling and prediction</li>
      <li>domain knowledge modeling in unstructured contexts</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
